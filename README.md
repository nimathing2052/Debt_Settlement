## Description 

Hey there! Welcome to our group project for the Data Structures and Algorithms Class at the Hertie School. Give this document a read to find out what we're doing!

In this project, we are aiming to develop a web application which can be used in the cases of Debt Settlement. The overarching goal of this project is to design and implement a robust web application tailored specifically for debt settlement scenarios. The application will provide a comprehensive set of features to guide users through the various stages of settling debts, ensuring a transparent, organized, and streamlined experience.

We are primarily using **Python's Flask** framework to develop this application. The technical process looks something like the following:

- Setting up the project environment, integrating Flask and necessary packages, and organizing the directory structure.
- User authentication and authorization are implemented using Flask-Login and Flask-WTF for secure form handling.
- Flask-SQLAlchemy is utilized for database integration, enabling the creation of models for user accounts, debts, and negotiations.
- The application incorporates financial analysis and negotiation logic, while document management and file uploads are handled using Flask-Uploads.
